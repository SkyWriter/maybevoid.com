## PL and PLT

The term "programming language" can be overloaded in many ways. For programmers
without much computer science background, they typically think of programming
language as designing new languages, mostly at the syntactic level with
semantics close to the mainstream languages that they are familiar with.
In computer science, programming languages may also refer to compiler design
and optimization.

To me, the programming language topics that I am interested in are more
about the mathematical theories behind programming languages. This includes
lambda calculus, type theory, category theory, etc. Often researchers in
this field would call themselves programming language researcher, or PL
researcher. But since the field is rather niche and programming languages
can mean many things to different people, I prefer to call it with a
qualified term _programming language theory_, or _PLT_.

Although Wikipedia have an
[official page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory)
about PLT, The term PLT is used informally only by some researchers,
such as in the Lisp community. There are research teams and projects
that use the acronym PLT, sometimes referring to Programming Language _Team_,
in their name, such as [Brown PLT](http://blog.brownplt.org/)
and [PLT Scheme](https://plt-scheme.org/) (now renamed to
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org/new-name.html)). While
researchers in other areas, such as ML and dependent types,
tend to use the more general term PL.

At MaybeVoid, I use the terms _PL_ and _PLT_ interchangeably to refer to
the same thing. When clarification is required, I typically use the
long form _programming language research_, or
_research topics in programming languages_ to refer to the same things
as PLT. This is just an unofficial convention that I adopt, and may not
be officially recognized beyond this website.
