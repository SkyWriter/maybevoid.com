## About Myself

My official name is Ruofei Chen (陈若飞), with Soares being my nickname. I am a
Malaysian Chinese grew up in Penang. I spent a little over ten years studying
and living in Singapore. I recently moved to Leipzig, Germany, and would stay
here for at least a while.

I am a programming language enthusiast for many years, spending most of my early
days hacking the web. In recent years, I got interested in functional programming
and started learning Haskell. That lead me into the rabbit hole of discovering
the world of programming language research.

I have many years of mainstream programming experience, although I am relatively
new in the fields of functional programming and programming language research.
There are many things that excites me and I am still learning a lot every day.
I started MaybeVoid to share the things I learned, and also to connect to
the broader programming language community around the world.

I really enjoy coding in Haskell, and would love to explore career opportunities
in Haskell or related works. If you would like to get in touch, do
