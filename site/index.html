  <p>
    Welcome to <a href="/pages/soareschen.html">Soares Chen</a>'s homepage MaybeVoid.
    My interest is in functional programming (Haskell, Rust, Ocaml, etc), and
    programming language research (dependent types algebraic effects, row polymorphism,
    session types, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, if you understands how the Haskell type <code>Maybe Void</code>
    is equivalent to <code>()</code>, or if you are interested in finding that out,
    then you might be interested to read my posts here.
