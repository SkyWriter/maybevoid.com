    MaybeVoid is the personal site for <a href="/pages/soareschen.html">Soares Chen</a>.
    I blog about functional programming in languages including
    <a href="/wiki/haskell.html"><i>Haskell</i></a>,
    <i>Racket</i>, <i>OCaml</i>, <i>Rust</i>. I also write about
    research topics in
    <a href="/wiki/programming-language-theory.html">programming language theory</a>
    including <i>Type Theory</i>, <i>Algebraic
    Effects</i>, <i>Linear Types</i>, and <i>Formal Verification</i>.

    In general, if you understands how the Haskell type <code>Maybe Void</code>
    is equivalent to <code>()</code>, or if you are interested in finding that out,
    then you might be interested to read my posts here.

    Implicit Effects
  </a>
</h3>

<p>
  Implictit Effects is a new effects library for Haskell that implements
  algebraic effects using implicit parameters and constraint kinds. The
  project is currently in draft state, with the code mostly ready and me
  still working on the documentation.
