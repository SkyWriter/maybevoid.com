This page contains the resources I found around the web learning
Haskell, which I find may be useful to others.

## Books

  - [Haskell in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth) -
    This book is an excellent resource for people with intermediate
    understanding on the programming aspects of Haskell, but lacks
    the historical and professional context to understand the Haskell
    _ecosystem_. The book goes deep into writing real world Haskell
    applications, without bogging the readers down with explanation
    about basic concepts in Haskell.
