title: Hello World
---

It has been a long while since I wanted to write about things I am
passionate about. Other than the time constraint of doing this on my
free time, my main dilemma have been on choosing between learning new
things or writing down the things that I have learned.

When I started my adventure into Haskell, I thought I'd just grasp
the core concepts in functional programming, and then write some
kick ass applications in Haskell. Instead I went deeper and found
out about [category theory](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).
From there on I learned type theory, dependent types, and less known
languages such as Agda and Coq. The more I learned outside of Haskell,
the less I feel I know comparing to the top Haskell programmers in
this world.

Haskell can be a pretty intimidating language, even for people like
me with many years of programming experience. It is not just about
the "scary" concepts like Monads, but also the tremendous amount
of math behind it. Granted, most Haskellers agree that you don't
need to understand the math to start programming in Haskell. But
to me, the math are so beautiful rather than scary, that I become
obsessed learning it rather than coming back to write some Haskell
code.

MaybeVoid is my attempt to contribute back to the Haskell community
on the little knowledge I learned over the years. I will share about
topics in programming languages from the perspective of an
intermediate Haskell programmer. At least for the beginning, it
would mostly be recap about things that are already well known to
the Haskell experts. I also take this as an opportunity to
solidify my programming knowledge, since writing about something
is also the best way of mastering the topic.

So let the adventure begins. If you have any feedback or comment,
please feel free to [let me know](/pages/about.html#contact).
