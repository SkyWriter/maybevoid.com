  MaybeVoid.com is the personal site of <a href="/contact.html">Soares Chen</a>.
  I blog about functional programming in languages including <i>Haskell</i>,
  <i>Racket</i>, <i>OCaml</i>, etc. I also write about research topics in programming
  languages including <i>Type Theory</i>, <i>Category Theory</i>, and
  <i>Formal Verification</i>.

  In general, if you understands how the Haskell type <code>Maybe Void</code>
  is equivalent to <code>()</code>, or if you are interested to find that out,
  then you might be interested to read my posts here.
