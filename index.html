    MaybeVoid is the personal site for Soares Chen.
    I blog about functional programming in languages including <i>Haskell</i>,
    <i>Racket</i>, <i>OCaml</i>, <i>Rust</i>, <i>JavaScript</i>. I also write
    about research topics in programming languages including <i>Type Theory</i>,
    <i>Algebraic Effects</i>, <i>Linear Types</i>, and <i>Formal Verification</i>.

    In general, if you understands how the Haskell type <code>Maybe Void</code>
    is equivalent to <code>()</code>, or if you are interested in finding that out,
    then you might be interested to read my posts here.
