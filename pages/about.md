title: About
---

MaybeVoid is the personal site for [Soares Chen](/pages/soareschen.html). I blog
about functional programming in languages including Haskell, Racket, OCaml,
Rust. I also write about research topics in programming languages including
Type Theory, Algebraic Effects, Linear Types, and Formal Verification.

In general, if you understands how the Haskell type `Maybe Void` is equivalent to
`()`, or if you are interested in finding that out, then you might be interested to
read my posts here.

### Target Audience

This site is mainly targeted towards Haskell enthusiasts with interest to learn
about Haskell and beyond. I would assume that you have at least some knowledge
in Haskell, and that you are into functional programming. I write about various
topics in programming languages, but it would be from the perspective of
intermediate Haskell programmers who are new to those topics.
